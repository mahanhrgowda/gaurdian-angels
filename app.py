For invocation, align practices with {common_element}’s energies {element_emojis[common_element]}: use {colors} colors 🎨, {imagery} imagery (e.g., {imagery}), {phases}, and {openness}. Here’s how to engage each:

•  Meditation 🧘: Sit quietly near {imagery} or with a representation of it. Visualize a soft {colors} light enveloping you. For {physical_angel['name']}, focus on diplomatic resolutions in your life; for {emotional_angel['name']}, seek revelations on hidden questions; for {intellectual_angel['name']}, contemplate personal transformation. Chant or affirm the angel’s name (e.g., “{physical_angel['name']}, guide my words with clarity”) for 5–10 minutes daily.

•  Sigils ✒️: Each angel has a traditional sigil derived from the Kabbalistic Rose Cross or Hebrew letters. Draw {sigil_text} on paper. Meditate on it while burning frankincense (for {common_element}’s mystical vibe) or placing it under moonlight 🌕.

•  Rituals 🕯️: Create a simple altar with {imagery}, a chalice or symbol of {common_element}, and {physical_angel['zodiac']}/{emotional_angel['zodiac']}/{intellectual_angel['zodiac']} symbols. On {ritual_date} (or any {common_element}-ruled day like Monday), light a {colors} candle and recite a psalm associated with the angel{psalm_text}. Offer thanks for guidance, then journal insights 📓. Repeat seasonally to strengthen the connection, always with pure intent for balance and growth 🌱.

full_report = overview_text + "\n\nTo calculate the birth angels, we start with the physical (or incarnation/guardian) angel 👼, which corresponds to the exact position of the Sun ☀️ at birth within the standard Kabbalistic assignment of the 72 angels to the zodiac (each governing a 5-degree segment). Based on the precise time ⏳, it aligns with angel number {physical_num}: {physical_angel['name']} (also spelled variations like Yeiaiel or Yeiayel for some).\n\nFrom there, the emotional (or heart) angel ❤️ is determined by adding 24 to the physical angel’s number (representing a 120-degree trine aspect in the zodiac for harmonious emotional support). The intellectual (or intellect) angel 🧠 adds 48 (a 240-degree trine for mental alignment). If the result exceeds 72, subtract 72 to cycle back. This yields:\n\n" + physical_text + "\n" + emotional_text + "\n" + intellectual_text + "\n" + common_element_text + "\n" + invocation_text + "\n\nThis framework can be adapted for any moment—simply compute the Sun's position for the physical angel, then apply the +24/+48 formula for the others."
